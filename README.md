# Fritzing Project: ESP8266-based sensor node #

This is my take on the hardware side of an ESP8266 based sensor node for home
automation purposes.

Use cases:

- Basic temperature and humidity sensor for each room
- Weather station with axtended set of sensors via i2c
- Soil moisture sensing

Features:

- low power consumption
- runs on 3 AA rechargeable batteries
